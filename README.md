# CheckSum-Possibility-RecursiveBacktracking
A program that calculates whether the sum of a subset of array elements is equal to the target number.
In this method, first the state where the set is empty is defined.
Second, the state where the target number is 0 is defined.
User types an array and then program creates subset of that array.
After that, it checks whether the sum of the elements of the created subsets is equal to the target number.
